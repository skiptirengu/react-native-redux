# React native redux boilerplate

A simple react native boilerplate with redux using the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) api.

### Features
+ Redux
+ NativeBase
+ Eslint with standard config
+ Babel 7
+ Up to date Android SDK and Gradle

## Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode. Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
